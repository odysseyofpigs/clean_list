Function definition:

	void nodupl(int *array, int sizeofarray)

-- Parameters --
	*array -- a pointer to a previously defined integer array.
	
	size -- the existing size of the given array as an integer.


-- Definition --
	The defined function, nodupl (no duplicate), takes an array of
	unsorted integers and removes all of the duplicate elements from the array.
	The removed duplicates are replaced with a placeholder integer, 0. This does
	not account for 0 already being an element within the array and will need to
	be dealt with at a later date.
	
	The theoretical runtime for the function to finish its best and worst case
	senario is O(n^2).
	
	Although not prime, it is a good starting point for the development of this
	function.



Function definition:

	void nosdupl(int *array, int sizeofarray)

-- Parameters --
	*array -- a pointer to a previously defined integer array. The array provided
		must be sorted.
	
	size -- the existing size of the given array as an integer.
	

-- Definition --
	The defined function, nosdupl (no sorted duplicate), takes an already sorted
	integer array and removes all the duplicate elements from within the array.
	The removed duplicates are replaced with a placeholder integer, 0. This does
	not account for 0 already being an element within the array and will need to
	be dealt with at a later date.
	
	The theoretical run time for the function to finish its best and worst case
	senario is O(n).



-- TODO --
	- improve nodupl and nosdupl so as the function takes in an array of any
		type and preforms the same operation.
	

I wrote this so you dont forget, dumbass.
