Function definition:

	void nodupl(int *array, int sizeofarray)

-- Parameters --
	*array -- a pointer to the previously defined integer array.
	
	size -- the existing size of the given array as an integer.


-- Definition --
	The defined function, nodupl (no duplicate), is able to take an array of
	unsorted integers and removes all of the duplicate elements from the array.
	The removed duplicates are replaced with a placeholder integer, 0. This does
	not account for 0 already being an element within the array and will need to
	be dealt with at a later date.
	
	The theoretical runtime for the function to finish its best and worst case
	senario is O(n^2).
	
	Although not prime, it is a good starting point for the development of this
	function.

-- TODO --
	- improve nodupl so as the function takes in an array of any type and
		preforms the same operation.
	
	- construct and push nosdupl (a similar function to nodupl, however takes
		into account that the that the array given is already sorted).
	

I wrote this so you dont forget, dumbass.
